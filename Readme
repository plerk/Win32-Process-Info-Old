Win32::Process::Info version 0.011

This module is intended to partly plug a perceived gap in Perl's Win32
functionality: the inability to traverse all (or nearly all) the processes
on the system, and get information on them. It is a partial plug because
only Windows NT (including Windows 2000) is supported. Windows "non-NT"
has a completely different mechanism for traversing the processes in the
system, I'm not in a position to tackle this, and half a loaf is certainly
no worse than none.

Because of Windows NT's security, it may not in fact be possible to see
literally every process; and some (e.g. process ID 0, the idle process)
may not have anything worth seeing. But this module does the best it can
with the rest.

Win32::Process::Info.pm contains POD documentation, which I do not
intend to repeat here. The following sample will give a flavor for how
it works.

use Win32::Process::Info;
my $pi = Win32::Process::Info->new ();
foreach $proc ($pi->GetProcInfo ()) {
    print "\n";
    foreach (sort keys %$proc) {
        print "$_ => $proc->{$_}\n";
        }
    }

That is to say, GetProcInfo returns a list of anonymous hashes
containing whatever information can be gleaned. The kit includes
a slightly more extensive script, ProcessInfo.pl, which produces
slightly friendlier output.

Win32::Process::Info uses two other libraries which are not part of the
standard Perl distribution (or weren't last time I looked!): Win32 (
which IS part of the ActivePerl distribution) and Win32::API (which is
as of about build 630).


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
------------ ------------

CPAN kit:

expand the kit using GZip and TAR (or equivalent). Then issue the
standard commands:

 perl Makefile.PL
 nmake
 nmake test
 nmake install

Note that the "test" step is optional.

See ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake if you need it.


PPM kit:

Expand the kit using unzip (or equivalent). Then

 ppm install Win32-ProcInfo.ppd


If all else fails:

Get the .pm files from your kit by whatever means you can, and drop
them in /site/lib/Win32/Process (or wherever ...).
