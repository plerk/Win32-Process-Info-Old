DESCRIPTION

This module is intended to partly plug a perceived gap in Perl's Win32
functionality: the inability to traverse all (or nearly all) the processes
on the system, and get information on them. In a futile effort to be all
things to all people, it has several variants, which are (semi-) trans-
parantly selected among on the fly, depending on the environment in which
it finds itself:
* WMI - used if WMI is found on the machine;
* NT - used if WMI is not found, but Win32::IsWinNT () is TRUE;
* PT - used if none of the above is found, but Proc::ProcessTable is.
If none of these obtains (e.g. you're running Windows 95), I'm afraid
you're out of luck. You actually have control of which variant is used,
should you choose to exercise it. See the docs for more detail.

Because of Windows NT's security, it may not in fact be possible to see
literally every process; and some (e.g. process ID 0, the idle process)
may not have anything worth seeing. But this module does the best it can
with the rest.

Win32::Process::Info.pm contains POD documentation, which I do not
intend to repeat here. The following sample will give a flavor for how
it works.

use Win32::Process::Info;
my $pi = Win32::Process::Info->new ();
foreach $proc ($pi->GetProcInfo ()) {
    print "\n";
    foreach (sort keys %$proc) {
        print "$_ => $proc->{$_}\n";
        }
    }

That is to say, GetProcInfo returns a list of anonymous hashes
containing whatever information can be gleaned. The kit includes
a slightly more extensive script, ProcessInfo.pl, which produces
very slightly friendlier output.

Win32::Process::Info uses other modules which are not part of the
standard Perl distribution (or weren't last time I looked!) Some are
only used under certain conditions, but you may see degraded
performance if you don't have them. The libraries used are
* Win32 - Required under Windows.
* Win32::API - Required only by the NT variant.
* Win32API::Registry - Used only by the NT variant. It's optional
    there, but if you don't have it you may get somewhat less
    information, because the debug privilege can't be set.
* Win32::OLE - Required only by the WMI variant.
* Proc::ProcessTable - Required by the PT variant, which will run under
    operating systems other than Windows.

With the exception of Proc::ProcessTable and (maybe) Win32::API, the
above are believed to be standard with the Windows version of
ActivePerl.

INSTALLATION

Most Perl users will want to install using their favorite of either
'cpan' or 'cpanp'. For either of these, installing Astro::Coord::ECI
gets you everything. ActivePerl users will want to use ActiveState's
'ppi', and install Astro-satpass.

If for some reason neither of these works for you, you can download the
distribution and expand it using something like

    tar -xzf Win32-Process-Info-9.999.tar.gz

Users of MSWin32 (and perhaps other operating systems) may need to
convert the line endings in the expanded files from Unix to their native
system before proceeding.

Then, issue one of the following two incantations:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

or

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    sudo ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.

Unix users may want to use 'su' rather than 'sudo' for the install.
Non-unix users may need to be logged in to an administrative or
otherwise privileged accout, and turn on privileges (if applicable) for
the install.

Of course, since it's pure Perl, you can just expand the kit and drop
the .pm files into the Win32/Process/Info directory (creating it if
necessary) in the appropriate place in your @INC directories.
